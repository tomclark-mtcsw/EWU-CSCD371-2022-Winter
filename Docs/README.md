## Instructors ##
[Mark Michaelis](https://github.com/MarkMichaelis), [Grant Erickson](https://github.com/GrantErickson), and [Meg Woodford](https://github.com/mmwoodfo)

For any general question we suggest asking in Microsoft Teams. This is a great place to collaborate and ask questions of both each other and the instructors. Though you can message people directly, as much as possible, we encourage open discussion on the meeting chat so that others can benefit as well.

You can also send an e-mail to: EWU-Instructors@IntelliTect.com

## Computer Setup ##

### Required ###
- [.NET 6.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)

Though most of the course work will be cross platform, we will be working on Windows inside of Visual Studio. For the UI portion of the class Visual Studio on Windows will be required. 

### Recommended ###
- [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/). Version 17.1 or later. The community edition is fine, though we believe most students should have access to higher SKUs with EWU's MSDN (this assumption may be wrong). Lab computers should have Professional already installed. This will install .NET 6.0.
- [GitKraken](https://gitkraken.keboo.dev/) Though you can do all of the git interaction from within Visual Studio or on the command line, GitKraken is free for open source work. It also provides a nice graphical version of the commit history so you can see how various commits and branches relate. 
- [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/students) Lots of great development tools and resources. The JetBrains products ReSharper (a plugin for Visual Studio), and Rider (a full C# IDE) are great tools for helping you write better code. 

### Optional ###
- [Visual Studio Live Share](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/services/live-share/) This lets you easily collaborate with other people on a share set of code. 
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) This can largely be used as an alternative to Visual Studio. Many of us also use it as our catch-all lightweight text/code editor.
- [GitExtensions](https://gitextensions.github.io/), [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/), (or any other git tool): There are lots of options out there for working with git. If there is a tool you like, use it! 

## Class Video ##
We will try to record class presentations so that students can review after class. [Recordings will be available here](https://www.dropbox.com/home/PhotosDrive/EWU/Current).
Please note:
* **Do not expect or rely on video recordings.**  We are not making any commitment to having video recordings of class. 
* Please keep all videos ***confidential***. These videos are for people enrolled in this class.  No videos or parts of videos should be copied/distributed/shared.
